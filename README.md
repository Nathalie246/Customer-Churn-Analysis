2.[Customer Churn Analysis] 👩🏻‍💻〽️
In this project, I focused on analyzing customer churn based on data such as customer ID, gender, payment method, monthly fees, total charges, cancellations, and customer tenure. I used visualizations to present key metrics such as the number of customers, churn rate, and subscribed services. I calculated the risk of customer attrition based on factors like monthly fees, number of complaints, and customer tenure. On the dashboard, I created visualizations showing the distribution of churn by service, payment method, and contract type, as well as revenue analysis. In this project, I utilized my skills in writing DAX formulas and visualizations, enabling the company to understand which customers are most at risk of leaving.
